# Schedule changes due to inclement weather
## created Feb. 15, 2021
Because of inclement weather, class was cancelled on Feb 11 and Feb 16.
Due to this, most activities and topics will be pushed back a week.
To accomodate this, the week of literature review proposal presentations will be cancelled
and all proposals will be written. Students will be assigned one of their classmates's
proposals to give feedback on. Dr. Smith will also grade and give feedback on these
written proposals.
