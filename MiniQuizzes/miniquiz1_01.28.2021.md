1. How does physiological ecology fit into the hierarchy of ecological studies? How
does it influence other levels?

2. Write three examples of how plant ecophysiology affects your life.

3. Chapin mentioned that we should consider plant physiological impacts on
large scale processes (e.g., community and ecosystem processes) through the lens of
biodiversity. What do you think he meant by that?

4. Why might plant ecophysiology be important for predicting and preparing for
the future effects of anthropogenic global change?
