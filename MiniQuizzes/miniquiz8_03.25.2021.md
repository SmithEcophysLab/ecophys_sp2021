1. Pick a national park. If you were a plant, what growth and reproductive strategies (including allocation strategy)
would you adopt to best survive and reproduce in that environment?

2. In class, we discussed ideal allocation strategies for different envi- ronments. 
However, we know that multiple strategies exist. Why is this the case?

3. Remember that translocation involves sugar movement through the phloem from source to sink cells. 
Many researchers have made the argument that these sinks control whole-plant photosynthesis. 
Why might this be the case?
