1. How would you expect elevated CO2 to change the competition between C3 and C4 species? Why?

3. Imagine your favorite ecosystem (natural or anthropogenic). 
Briefly introduce it it and use a systems diagram to explain how you would expect total carbon uptake
to differ with elevated CO2? Use boxes and arrows for your diagram and add either a "+", "-", or "+/-"
sign to each arrow. Your left-hand box should be "atmospheric CO2" and your right-hand box should
be "ecosystem CO2 uptake".
