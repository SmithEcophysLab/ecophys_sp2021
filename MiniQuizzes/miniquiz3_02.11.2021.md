1. Can an individual plant be sun and shade adapted?

2. Why do C4 plants tend to have faster rates of photosynthesis at high light than C3 plants?

3. How might transpiration change across a light gradient?

4. How might leaf respiration change across a light gradient?

5. The light saturation point is the light level at which photosynthesis is saturated.
Where would you expect short-statured (<2 meters) species to have low light saturation
points? Where would you expect this point to be high for short-statured plants?
