1. Plant physiological processes often involve tradeoffs. 
Name one of these tradeoffs and provide an ecological context under which this tradeoff may be important.

2. Briefly explain how photosynthesis can be limited by light or CO2.

3. Draw the expected response of photosynthesis to change in light, CO2, O2, and soil nitrogen.

4. Von Caemmerer and Farquhar performed their experiments using Phaseolus vulgaris, or common bean. 
This species is a leguminous (i.e., nitrogen fixing) species with C3 photosynthesis. 
Do you think their experiments would have turned out differently using a different species? If so, how?
