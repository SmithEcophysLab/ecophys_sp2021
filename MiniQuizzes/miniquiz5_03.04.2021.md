1. Describe a tradeoff associated with isohydry in plants.

2. Present a case for how an additional environmental factor may interact with water 
availability to influence plant function. 
Draw or describe a figure describing this hypothesized interaction.

3. With climate change, precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable, 
with stronger individual events coupled with greater time periods in between events. 
Propose a hypothesis for how you might expect these effects to influence plant form 
and functioning at the individual, community, or ecosystem level.
