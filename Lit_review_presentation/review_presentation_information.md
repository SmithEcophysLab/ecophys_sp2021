# Information about review presentations

### Objective
The objective of the review presentations is for each student or group to present
the main points and findings from their review papers. Presentations do not need to include
all the information from the review paper, but should address each of the main points.
There will be time after each presentation for a question and answer session with the audience.

### Format
The format will consist of an oral presentation of the main findings and insights from the review.
The presentation should last ~10-15 minutes, with an addition 5 minutes for question and answer.
As such, not all information from the review paper
needs to be included in the presentation.

### Grading
Both the written and oral proposal will be graded. Please refer to the 
[rubric](../Rubrics/review_rubric.md) for more information and contact Dr. Smith
if you have additional questions.
